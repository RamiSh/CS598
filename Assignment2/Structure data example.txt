Project Name
Pull Request Notifier

Project Description
While teams are busy developing new features and tackling tech debts it becomes challenging to keep track of all open PRs. A simple visual reminder has proven to be effective.
A few things this helps with:
- Reminds the team about what is awaiting review which will reduce the chances for others to be blocked
- Aggregates all links to all PRs in one place
- Gives sense of urgency by showing the time since the PR has been issued
- Pushes the pending PRs to the top of the designated notification channel

Tech Stack
- AWS Lambda
- Netcore 3.1
- Terraform aws provider 2.57.0 (to support core 3.1)

How to use this
- Installation
This runs as a serverless lambda, no installation is needed.
- Usage
Add you team name to the SubscribedTeams. The team name is case insensitive, and is not used to look up any of the PRs.
Add a new section for your team with (WebhookUrl, IncludeDraftPullRequests, and RepositoriesToProjectsMap)
The system will push the pending PRs to the top of the designated notification teams channel
This runs twice a day at 9am and 3pm central time Monday-Friday. There is a cloudwatch event for each time.

Development
- Development Setup
All what's needed to run this locally is to have visual studio installed with .netcore 3.1. Vs Code also works in case you a light-weight approach is preferred.
- Deployment Notes
To test your changes, you can run add break points to force the run time to stop to debug the changes. However, this will eventually send notifications out if ran to completion. Better to test with a sample list of teams.
